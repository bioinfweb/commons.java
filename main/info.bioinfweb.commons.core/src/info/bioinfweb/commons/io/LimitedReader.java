/**
 * Guarantees that no more characters as specified are read from the decorated reader. It is though possible, that the decorated
 * reader reads beyond the read limit from its underlying reader (e.g. if a {@link BufferedReader} is decorated).
 * <p>
 * In contrast to many similar classes, the focus of this class is not on limiting the number of characters to be returned by this
 * reader, but to make sure that not more characters than specified can be read from the underlying reader. It can e.g. be used
 * to ensure that reading beyond the read ahead limit of a call of {@link #mark(int)} is not possible.
 * <p>
 * Note that for testing the end of the underlying stream one character more needs to be read from the decorated reader than can
 * be returned by this instance. Therefore one character less than the limit specified in the constructor will at most be returned.
