/**
 * Comparator for instances of {@link StreamLocationProvider}, which uses 
 * {@link StreamLocationProvider#getCharacterOffset()} as the only comparison criterion.
 * <p>
 * Note that the line and column number properties are not taken into account. As a consequence
 * this comparator is not necessarily consistent with the {@code equals(Object)} methods of the implementations of 
 * {@link StreamLocationProvider}. (If this comparator returns 0 for two objects, these objects are not
 * necessarily equal, they only have the same character offset.) Therefore this comparator should
 * not be used together with sorted sets or sorted maps, as described in the documentation of {@link Comparator}.
