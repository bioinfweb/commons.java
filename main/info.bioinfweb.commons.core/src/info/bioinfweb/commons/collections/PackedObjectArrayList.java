/**
 * Implements a packed list of objects which uses an underlying instance of {@link PackedIntegerArrayList}.
 * All equal objects in the list are represented by the an integer number stored in the underlying list and
 * the methods reading and writing objects perform a conversion between these numbers and the concrete object
 * instances.
 * <p>
 * The compression method of this class works best of the list contains a limited set of different objects
 * multiple times. If different equal object instances are add to this list only the object that was add 
 * first will be returned for all positions occupied by an equal object (which should not be a problem with
 * equal objects.)
 * <p>
 * Due to the compression method the maximum number of expected different objects has to be specified when
 * creating instances of this class. Each a new type of object is add to the list an specific integer value
 * will be assigned to it. Note that such values will always remain associated with this object even if
 * all objects of this kind (objects that are equal to each other) are removed from the list. So each additional
 * object that differs from all previously added objects will contribute to the number of supported different 
 * objects that can be stored, no matter if any of these objects is removed again later on.
