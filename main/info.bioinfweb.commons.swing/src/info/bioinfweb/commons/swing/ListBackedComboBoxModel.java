/**
 * An implementation of {@link ComboBoxModel} that always reflects the contents of a {@link List}.
 * <p>
 * Note that this model does reflect changes in the underlying list that occur after the creation of this object but will not inform its 
 * listeners on these. (The underlying list cannot be monitored.) The methods {@link #add(Object)}, {@link #add(int, Object)}, 
 * {@link #set(int, Object)}, {@link #remove(int)} and {@link #clear()} allow to edit the underlying list and notify all listeners 
 * registered to this model and the same time. It is recommended to use these methods instead of modifying the list directly if changes
 * should be made to a list that is currently displayed in the GUI, e.g., in an instance of {@link JList}.
