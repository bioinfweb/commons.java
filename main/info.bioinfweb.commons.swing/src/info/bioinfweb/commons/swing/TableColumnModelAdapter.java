 * <An abstract adapter class for receiving events of a {@link TableColumnModel}. 
 * The methods in this class are empty. This class exists as convenience for creating 
 * listener objects.
 * <p>
 * Extend this class to create a {@link TableColumnModelListener} listener and 
 * override the methods for the events of interest. (If you implement the 
 * {@link TableColumnModelListener} interface, you have to define all of the 
 * methods in it. This abstract class defines null methods for them all, so 
 * you can only have to define methods for events you care about.)
